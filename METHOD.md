# Method

Explore an Idea

Goals:

0. Cooperatively explore topics which matter to people around me.


Assumptions:

0. Positive feeling precedes cooperative communication.
0. Not all disagreements can be resolved.
0. Disagreement does not necessitate conflict.
0. Not all conflicts can be resolved.
0. Cooperation can maximize value for all parties even when conflict is irreconcilable.


Rules:

0. Follow a "Tomato Clock" /w breaks.
   - Play / Break / LongBreak
   - 9 / 3 / 9
   - 20 / 5 / 20
0. Anyone can stop the conversation for any reason with a TimeOut or a GameOver
  - Person who initiates GameOver must leave the space within a reasonable timeframe.
  - TimeOut can be started with hand or verbal signal and everyone must stop talking immediately.
  - Timeout lasts for the duration of a LongBreak or until TimeIn is called by same person.
  - Each player get's 2 TimeOuts per game.
0. One person speaks at a time.
0. Non-normatively (excluding "positivism").
   - "No should-ing on others" - but evidence of a claim is expected if asked for.
   - Use logic and data to make arguments.

### Problem

> Coming to a clear understanding of any problem using Metaphysics is not reliable.

### Goal

> Create a Problem Solving Game based on "Positive Methodology".

### Propositions

 - Metaphysics form an unreliable foundation for solving problems.

 - Metaphysical Ontology does not allow for clear linking of causal relationships.

 - Relationships which used to be explained by Metaphysics are now explained by Physics.
    - This is because problems with Physics can be demonstrated and explored in relatively unambiguous terms, and by using models which rely on mathematics to ensure logical coherence.

 - Metaphysics are not "bad" - just indeterminate.

### Positive Epistemology

Why should you accept that life proceeds by a process of Natural Selection and not by a Metaphysical Miracle?  

You "shouldn't".

You may believe whatever you find compelling and and useful, and to consider your beliefs in ways that can be tested.

It is important to recognize our `Fundamental Ignorance` which leaves open the possibility for new discovery.

A valid model is not expected to explain everything.

Valid models should have some predictive power.

> Note: that we can only update our Knowledge by executing a Test or (Axiomatically) by exploring a Paradigm.

```mermaid

    Knowledge --> Paradigm
    Paradigm --> Knowledge
    Paradigm --> Analysis
    Theory --> Proposition
    Proposition --> Test
    Test --> Analysis 
    Analysis --> Knowledge
```

 - `Knowledge` == Sensible information stored in human memory.
 - `Paradigm` == Predictive Models /w explanation; taken to be true.
 - `Theory` == Provisional models which fit with a given paradigm.
 - `Proposition` == Statement which can be tested.
 - `Test` == Method of testing propositions.
 - `Analysis` == Consider what the test means in relationship to the working paradigm.


#### Bayesian Credence

### Positive Ethics

 - Ethics is a highly speculative subject.
 - Much of the subject is based on metaphysical concepts.
 - Legal Positivism is a highly relevant.
 - Sociology is dubious, and becoming more positive over time.
 

#### Pragmatics

Physics and Biology are rigorous subjects with clear definitions, repeated experiment, and peer review - however many relevant problems are social and not physical in nature.

For this we have Pragmatics:

>  The facts with which pragmatics deals are of various sorts, including:
> - Facts about the objective facts of the utterance, including: who the speaker is, when the utterance occurred, and where;
> - Facts about the speakerâ€™s intentions. ...what language the speaker intends to be using, what meaning she intends to be using, whom she intends to refer... and the like. ...what she intends to achieve by saying what she does.
> - Facts about beliefs of the speaker and those to whom she speaks, and the conversation they are engaged in; what beliefs do they share; what is the focus of the conversation, what are they talking about, etc.
> - Facts about relevant social institutions, such as promising, marriage ceremonies, courtroom procedures, and the like, which affect what a person accomplishes in or by saying what she does.
