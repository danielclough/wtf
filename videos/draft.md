So, WTF?

That's a good question.
I like questions.

You have probably heard, "I think therefore I am".
We wouldn't have all this fancy technology if not for that guy, but he had some weird ideas about things.
It's interesting how someone who's ideas transformed all the world could be wrong about so many things.

How important is an accurate conception of reality?

Some relatively authoritative people think that we live in a simulation.
How reasonable is that proposition?

A professional astrophysicists and science communicator, Neil deGrasse Tyson, is quoted in [scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-we-live-in-a-simulation-chances-are-about-50-50/) gives it 50 / 50 chances.

50/50 chances seem high to me, but as you know - opinions are like ass holes.

I should probably just believe what the guy on TV believes, right?

I wonder what the ethical implications of believing this idea with a relatively high probability - you know - contrasted with complete agnosticism - firm doubt - or unshakable conviction.

I often think of 

### Brahma
By Ralph Waldo Emerson

> If the red slayer think he slays,
> Or if the slain think he is slain,
> They know not well the subtle ways
> I keep, and pass, and turn again.

The poem is about the religious text, the Bhagavad Gita, wherein Arjuna is persuaded to kill his kinsman and take rule of the kingdom...

I don't think these people are getting ready to go on a killing rampage - but it's notable that a denial of the reality of people as real can easily lead to the most radical ethical position so easily.

I was raised with a liberal agnostic view and a strong philosophical influence.
My father left the Catholic Church in disgust, but remained deeply religious until his dying day.
When I became disrespectful towards religious people in my early teens he said, "I brought you to the Unitarian Universalist Church so you would have a community, not so you could learn to be a bigot".
I had a lot of respect for my father, so I tried to be more respectful towards religious people, and I ended up reading a ton about different religions.
I still think religion is a basically a con game - but it's hard to discount mystical experience - so I spent some years living with different cults and learning how to have altered states of experience from religious traditions.

I guess the first time I had - what I'll call a psychedelic experience - must have been in preschool.
I don't remember much, but by the 5 Levels I know from Timothy Leary I would say that it was "level 1".
Later when I learned techniques to alter my experience I've had experiences so profound they range into the ineffable.
That means basically that my memory is/was filled with experience which contradict what are commonly known to be "the laws of nature".

My father was locked away for hallucinations after Vietnam, so I learned early in life that talking to people is generally an unsafe activity.
I talked with my dad about my mental condition enough to get some solid guidance... perhaps hallucinations are way of communicating with deeper parts of myself... whatever that means.

I had anger issues, but my hallucinations were all when I was alone and safe.
Was it Daniel Dennett who commented on the safely valve for these kinds of experiences?
Anyway, it was very clear that the greatest danger to my safety would be telling anyone unsafe - which was everyone but my father.

One of the most important moments of my life was when I read a short book by Thich Nhat Hanh about "The Buddha Smile".
I had already realized that people didn't care about my experience, they only care about my actions, and I was struggling to control my temper.
I tried to put on a pleasant face - and what do you know!
People started treating me better!
That got me started on Buddhism - but, not really.

Labels are strange things.
My first minister at the UU church was a Buddhist, if I recall correctly, so I've had a vague sense of what Buddhism is about for longer than I can remember.

Anyway, reading about Shamatha Vipassana and playing with those ideas was pretty important from a young age, and profoundly stabilizing.


By the time I started doing drugs the spontaneous hallucinations were happening less frequently, and I was able to moderate the experiences more than before.
I recognized the drug experience as being very similar to my other altered states and I explored my mind on many drugs over many years.

I got kicked out of highschool for showing a bag of weed to my class.

Motivation is a strange thing.
Why did I stand up, pull out a bag of weed, and start talking about it loudly in class?
Other people seem to have "good excuses" for doing things, but I have always had difficulty understanding my own motivations.

In the second grade I told my teacher she was a Bitch...
She asked what I said, to which I apologized that it was unkind to female dogs...
I remember because I had been building up courage to do more than throw things while the teacher was not looking since Kindergarten.

Now in retrospect I feel sorry for her.
Working in public education is hard thankless labor.
But, she was also a drone in a coercive system of lies and bullshit...

I find Chinese philosophy very interesting.
There is a beautiful story about a mystical force which overturns unjust government.
It's not a fast acting force as it took three generations.

I also appreciate Indian philosophy.
It is interesting to think about the unity of creation, existence, and destruction.

So I have this question.
How can I believe that government actors conspire to deceive the public about drugs, and other issues, but I don't believe that my sense data under the influence is an accurate portrayal of "The World Out There"?

Perhaps the most important question is "how much danger am I in"?

If I abstract away concerns for my safety in a metaphysical narrative about the religious, programmatic, or otherwise unreal nature of my existence... well that exposes me to risk.

Imagine I'm a crusader - and I attribute my natural psychedelic experience to the story told my my church...
If the pie in the sky account of reality is wrong than I could loose my only life...
Or, perhaps I'm a nationalist and I think the value of my life comes from the conventions of my culture...

I remember the sage words,
> "If you think you can fly, take off from ground level."

I'm not going to repeat the oft told story about the predator in the grass and unequal value of false positives vs. false negatives... but it's a story worth knowing.

What does this say about my epistemology?
If you don't know the term that means basically "my theory of knowledge".

Well, I generally identify as a Positivist.
That means that truthy knowledge should have an empirical, rational basis - otherwise it's Metaphysics.
Metaphysics is another way of saying "not my problem".
Other thinkers have taken a different approach, but I don't even feel the need to be agnostic about metaphysics.
[Etymonline says,](https://www.etymonline.com/word/agnostic) Agnostic is from 1870, "one who professes that the existence of a First Cause and the essential nature of things are not and cannot be known".
To me this goes to far. Certainly a First Cause is unknown, but I have been wrong too often to try to make claims about know-ability - and why bother?


There has been an active conversation in the scientific community about the nature of truth since before science was a common word.
Historically, Positivism was pretty strong, for a while, but then with Quantum Mechanics things got weird.

![Niels Bohr Shocked Quote](http://www.gestaltreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Niels-Bohr-Quantum-Mechanics-Real-Shocked.jpg)

Some Scientists, like Einstein, tried to hold onto classical notions of truth, which presumed it's own set of metaphysics...

I have heard contemporary scientists sorta blame other scientists for what amounts to "bad science" and distrust in the institutions of science.

So when this I met this guy at the park today, and he had really unconventional views, I compare that to my friends who think that this is a simulation and think... ok... more strange ideas.
I've not heard his story before exactly but most current ideas are some alteration of older ideas I've read about from religions around the world and early modern cults and secret societies.

My primary interest in recording our conversation is to find out if I can develop an AI which will be able to predict future opinions based on previous ones.

I don't understand or endorse any of his views.

Since I needed to run the audio through a transcription AI I clipped 
I didn't manage to get my microphone working.






I find my conscious action as being very much like the confabulation of today's AI.
I don't know if you have ever been talking and found that you had just lied?
I have noticed that before. How awkward. It's like waking yourself up snoring.

When I was in my early adulthood I said something I was not proud of and I thought - "I need to get a handle on this speech thing".
So, I stopped talking.
That worked pretty well, so I stopped talking for 7 months.

I have a friend who can not verbalize in their head.
I had constant verbalization going on - it was a bit overwhelming - so I focused on my breath until all day I felt deeply into my body.
Many hours of sitting very still - I had given up on drugs.
You could say that the drugs gave a very noisy experience - I was thinking a lot about an ancient tradition called "Sankya".
They use the metaphor of reflection on a pond.
A clear reflection comes from stillness - I was hyperactive...

I was willing to be homeless to have time to explore my mind.
I practiced all kinds of esoteric arts, lived at a few communes, joined a few cults...
I could never be a true believer though...
Like watching a movie I can suspend disbelief and lean into a hallucination but there is always the part of me that remembers my father telling me how we draw an atom like a solar system because it's accurate to the use, but nobody but nobody seriously believes it looks like that... isn't my visual felid like that?
